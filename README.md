## Project Overview

Winter Shop is a Flask-based web application for fashion item search, recommendation, and review analysis. It features:
- Advanced search with typo correction and suggestions
- Machine learning-based review recommendation (ensemble of LogisticRegression, SVM, LightGBM)
- TF-IDF weighted FastText vectors for text features
- Interactive web interface with dark/light mode

## Environment Setup

### 1. Create and Activate Conda Environment, Please make sure the python environment is 3.12 (for gensim and matplot integration)

```sh
conda env create -n myenv python=3.12
conda activate myenv
```

### 2. Download Libraries requirements

The app will attempt to download required NLTK resources automatically. If you encounter errors, run:

```sh
conda env update -f environment.yml -n myenv
```

### 3. Run the Application

```sh
python app.py
```

Visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.

## File Structure

- `app.py` — Main Flask application
- `models/` — Trained ML models and vectorizers
- `templates/` — HTML templates (Jinja2)
- `static/` — CSS and JavaScript files
- `data/` — CSV data and schema

---

## Model Information

- **Ensemble:** LogisticRegression, SVM, LightGBM
- **Features:** TF-IDF weighted FastText vectors
- **Training Data:** Processed review data from Milestone 1

---

## Notes

- All Python and data science dependencies are managed via `requirements.yml` (Conda environment). This is due to the inconsistent download and building from the pip command
- Please use the conda install as instructions above.
- If you need to install additional packages, use `conda install <package>` or `pip install <package>` after activating the environment.
- For any issues with missing NLTK data, refer to step 2 above.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Port in use:** If port 5000 is busy, change the port in `app.py` when running `app.run()`.
- **Model loading errors:** Ensure all files in `models/` are present and compatible with your Python version.
- **Search/ML errors:** Check that all required data files are in the `data/` directory.
